# Portfolio-simple-website
This repository contains the code for my basic portfolio website built using HTML and CSS.  Portfolio website consists of two main pages: the home page and the contact page. The home page showcases information about my background, skills, and a glimpse of my projects. The contact page includes a form and details for getting in touch with me.
